There are typically\ntwo types of generators - simple boilerplate 'copiers' and more advanced generators\nwhich can use custom prompts, remote dependencies and can do a lot more.\n\n* [quickstart](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/quickstart#readme) -\na basic boilerplate generator with jQuery, Modernizr and HTML5 Boilerplate\n* [yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/yeoman/app#readme) -\nthe default yeoman generator, which includes prompts and more advanced capabilities.\n\nRead about the capabilities of our generators in our\n[docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/docs/cli/generators.md). This guide will also cover how to create a new generator template using the command-line.\n\n## Testing generators\n\nThere is currently no formal infrastructure for testing generators, however you may find our [mocha generator](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Testing-generators) for custom generators useful.\n\n## Generators Included\n\n* [AngularJS](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/angular#readme)\n* [Backbone](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/backbone#readme)\n* [BBB (Backbone Boilerplate)](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/bbb#readme)\n* [Chrome Apps Basic Boilerplate](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/chromeapp#readme)\n* [Ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/ember#readme)\n* [Ember-Starter](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/ember-starter#readme)\n* [Jasmine](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/jasmine/app#readme)\n* [Mocha](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/mocha/app#readme)\n* [QuickStart]((https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/quickstart#readme)\n* [Testacular](https://github.com/yeoman/generators/tree/master/lib/generators/testacular/app#readme)\n",
